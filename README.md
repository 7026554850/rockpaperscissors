# rockpaperscissors

# Script.js - Most of the project is in the javascript file as the game is played completely in the console.
# This project aims at creating the Rock paper scissor game that is played, by the user against the computer, on the console of Chrome Dev Tools.
# We use two functions one each to generate the inputs of their choice from the computer and the user respectively.
# A loop is used to run multiple rounds of the game declaring the respective inputs of the player and the winner of each round of the game after comparing the inputs. Also the scores of the players are also updated with the end of each round.
# Finally a conditional operator is used to compare the final scores and declare the winner of the game.

# index.html - No code entered except for the customary requirement along with a script tag linking the external script.js file.
